## Overview
We participated in a **34-hour data hackathon** where we were challenged to help Modecraft â€” a global ecommerce store â€” uncover actionable insights to increase their online revenue.

### Our Goals:
- Clean and prepare a large transactional dataset  
- Analyze trends across time, geography, and customer behavior  
- Develop interactive data visualizations that tell a clear, compelling story  
- Propose data-backed recommendations for growing Modecraftâ€™s sales

## Tools Used

**Data Cleaning:**
- Google Sheets / Microsoft Excel  
- Python (via Google Colab)

**Data Visualization Website:**
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- Excel  
- Power BI  

**Deployment:**

## Data Cleaning Process
We cleaned the dataset individually using both Python (in Google Colab) and Excel, and then merged our findings to finalize a clean version for analysis.  

### Key Steps Included:
- Removed rows with null or invalid values  
- Added helpful derived columns:
  - Revenue = Quantity Ã— Unit Price
  - Day of Week, Time of Day, Weekday/Weekend, Quarter  
- Standardized Product Name values  
- Ensured proper formatting for date and time fields
